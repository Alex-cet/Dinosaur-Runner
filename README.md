# Dinosaur-Runner
This project was made using .NET and C# as a Windows Form application. The game features the common "Dinosaur T-Rex Game" that appears on Google Chrome when you have no internet connection. When you open the app a message for starting the game will be shown. After pressing the key, the background will be generated and the obstacles will be generated in a random time interval and with random height. The "space" key will trigger the jump animation for the dinosaur and if the dinosaur will hit the cactus, the game will end and a message will be shown with the score of the user that is represented by the number of seconds in-game. The collision between the dinosaur and cactus was made considering the original game, having a hitbox, which means the dinosaur can hit the cactus if it jumps too late or too fast. Enjoy!
